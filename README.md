# Running tests

Testing requires a valid Northbound API account. Tests will look for two environment variables to get user account (FUSIONSOLAR_USER) and password (FUSIONSOLAR_PASSWORD).

Use the following command from directory root to run the tests:
```console
python3 -m unittest discover
```

# Using CI

In case of a fork, these same variables (FUSIONSOLAR_USER and FUSIONSOLAR_PASSWORD) shall be added to github secrets in order for the CI to work.
